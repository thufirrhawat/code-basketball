# README
These are the files for the book [Learn to Code with Basketball](https://codebasketball.com).

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click the `Source
code` link under the latest release to download the files.  This will download
a file called `code-basketball-files-vX.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the latest
version.

When you unzip these (note in the book I've dropped the version number and
renamed the directory just `code-basketball-files`, which you can do too)
you'll see four sub-directories: `code`, `data`, `anki`,
`solutions-to-excercises`.

You don't have to do anything with these right now except know where you put
them. For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/code-basketball-files`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\code-basketball-files`

Set these aside for now and we'll pick them up in chapter 2.

## Changelog
### v0.1.0 (2023-04-21)
Heard from a reader (thanks Arnold!) that some of the nbasense API endpoints no
longer worked, and updated the book to use only the ones that do. Doesn't
impact things too much since this was mainly for demonstration purposes.

### v0.0.4 (2022-12-16)
Fixed a few typos (thanks Victor!)

### v0.0.3 (2022-12-02)
Minor rewording.

Fix minor typo.
